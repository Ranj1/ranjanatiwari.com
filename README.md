# My Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with Next.js (App Router).  
I created this site to showcase my experience, skills, and the projects I've worked on over the years.  
It’s a simple, clean, and fast website with smooth scrolling and section-based navigation.

### ✨ What’s inside
- Next.js 13/14 App Router structure (`app/`)
- Reusable React components for each section (About, Skills, Experience, Projects)
- Sidebar navigation with active-section highlighting
- Intersection Observer for scroll-based animations
- Responsive layouts with clean CSS modules
- Deployed build exported in the `out` folder

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js**
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Framer Motion** (for subtle animations)
- **react-intersection-observer** (active section detection)
